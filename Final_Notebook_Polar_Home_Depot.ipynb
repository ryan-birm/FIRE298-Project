        "### Background\n",
        "Polar lows are fast-forming mesocyclones that are capable of reaching hurricane-like forces (Terpstra and Watanabe). The shape of these storms can either be circular with an eye in the center or in the shape of a comma. The ability to identify these storms and notify coastal communities who may be affected could help them better prepare to face the storm's effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goals\n",
        "The goal of our research is to improve the identification and classification of Polar Lows using machine learning models by expanding upon our final project from FIRE 198, further developing it to produce more accurate identification results. We will partially accomplish this by implementing a CNN model called AlexNet using the Pytorch framework. We found a guide for this implementation on GitHub written by Machine Learning Engineer Daniel Bourke (Bourke).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "Our motivation is to improve automation the classification of satellite imagery data as a polar low or nonpolar low storm image for the sake of furthering technological improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are also motivated to help communities affected by polar lows which would be achieved through accurate identificaiton of the storms using satellite imagery."

        "To begin our brainstorming process, we created a document to contribute each of our ideas for how to approach solving our research problem. We generated ideas by looking at research articles of image classfication models and previous models that were created by FIRE peer mentors. Upon deliberation, we attempted to implement three strategies: small image training, data dropping for our decision tree, and replacing the original images with IR/water image data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We started with attempting to resize the images but found out that the pretrained models worked best with images of a certain size. From this we learned that we should continue by implementing a better model than the one we had used before - Google Teachable Machine. After doing some research, we decided that a  model would be AlexNet as it has a high accuracy with our dataset."

        "The accuracy of Alexnet alone improves the classification of polar lows from the teachable machine from 73% to around 81%. When implementing the decision tree, the model further improved to 100%.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have faith in our model's accuracy reports, except we are a bit skeptical that the final result was 100%. This overestimated accuracy may be due to a low amount of testing data - we only used 139 images to feed into the decision tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "For future research, the classification of polar lows can be improved by editing the hyperparameters such as the epochs, the loss function, or the layers in the decision tree. Additionally, data dropping can be implemented. Data can be randomly dropped during training to avoid overfitting. We are also interested in implementing more features to the decision tree for the image to be evaluated on before making a final classification prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "NOTE: There may be some discrepancies in the accuracy of our model. After looking at the training and testing split data, we found a few images that were mislabeled in the data frame, duplicates, or in the wrong folder. This messed up the 80-20 training testing split for both the non-polar low and polar low images.\n"
